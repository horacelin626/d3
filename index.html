          <h2>Correlations between 3 health risk factors against three perhaps underlying factors</h2>
          <p class="text-primary">We explore the correlations (state-level data) between three health risk factors (obesity, smoking, and uninsured rates) against three perhaps underlying factors (median household income, poverty level, and median age) using survey data collected from <a href = "https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml">U. S. Census Data</a>. Each marker represents an individual state. Click on any of the axis titles to start exploring!</p>
		  <h4>Observations:</h4>
		  <p class="text-primary"> 
			  1. A positive correlation between poverty levels vs. levels of uninsured individuals.<br> 
			  2. A positive correlation between poverty vs. obesity and poverty vs. smoking levels.<br> 
			  3. A negative correlation between all three outcomes (uninsured individuals, obesity & smoking levels)  vs. median household income.<br> 
			  4. No obvious correlation between obesity vs. median age or smoking levels vs. median age.
			  5. A weak negative correlation between uninsured individuals vs. median age.<br> 
			  5. The smoking percentage shows a positive correlation vs. median age, as older populations appear to smoke more.<br> 
			  6. No obvious correlation between median age and obesity rates.<br> 
			  7. Texas had the highest uninsured rate while Massachusetts had the least. <br> 
			  8. West Virginia, Kentucky and  Arkansas are the top 3 states with the highest smoking levels. <br> 
			  9. Utah has the lowest percentage of smokers among all states. Utah is also the youngest state by median age, and smoking percentage does tend to decrease with a younger population.<br> 
			  10. Arkansas, West Virginia and Mississippi are the top 3 states with the highest obesity levels. <br>  
			  11. Colorado, Washington DC and Hawaii are the top 3 states with the lowest obesity levels.

		  <h4>Final Thoughts:</h4>
		  <p class="text-primary">
		    This data is from the year 2014. An interesting fact is that the Affordable Care Act also went into effect in 2014 (Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act">Wikipedia</a>). It would be interesting to see how this data has changed in the last few years.
